By embracing irony and contradiction, they encourage users to question the underlying assumptions of everyday objects and systems. Datta+Baum Studio aims to inspire rebellion, spark conversations, and invite individuals to find their own meaning within the inherent absurdity of the world.
At Datta+Baum Studio, authenticity and passion drive their designers. They cultivate a culture that embraces the absurdity in their lives and channels it into the creative process. By rebelling against the absurd, they create designs that resonate on a deeper level, evoking emotions and prompting contemplation.
